dem_str = """Context: we report the case of a patient with b-cell prolymphocytic leukemia who was successfully
treated with the novel humanized monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab. this patient was previously treated
with the combination of rituximab and bendamustine and had recurrent infusion reactions. her treatment
with rituximab and bendamustine was discontinued when she developed disease progression after 3 cycles
of therapy. she was then treated with obinutuzumab 1000 mg on day 1 of every cycle and chlorambucil
0.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days to which she had greater tolerability. after 4 cycles of treatment,
she had resolution of her clinical symptoms, massive splenomegaly, and normalization of her white blood
cell count.
Answer: [cytopenia, treatment failure]

Context: sarcoid associated pulmonary hypertension (saph) is a common complication of sarcoidosis
and is associated with poor prognosis. saph can be due to multiple synergistic mechanisms and current
therapeutic strategies treat systemic sarcoidosis and pulmonary hypertension separately. several studies
have been performed to develop an effective therapy for saph but have been met with mixed results. the
ambition trial successfully treated incident patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) with the
upfront combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil; however combination therapy has not yet been studied
in patients with saph. here we report a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed saph who were treated
with upfront combination therapy per the ambition study protocol. we report three subjects with newly
diagnosed saph who were treated with combination ambrisentan and tadalafil. baseline hemodynamics
were compared with those from surveillance right heart catheterization while on therapy. mean follow
up period was 17 months. each subject demonstrated clinical and hemodynamic improvement with
combination therapy. this series is the first to evaluate upfront combination ambrisentan and tadalafil
therapy for treatment of newly diagnosed saph. despite the impressive clinical and hemodynamic
improvement, the study is limited by its small size and retrospective nature. while these initial results are
promising, further work is needed to fully evaluate this regimen for treatment of saph. (sarcoidosis vasc
diffuse lung dis 2020; 37 (2): 234-238).
Answer: [off label use, urosepsis]

Context: haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic drug. this drug is still widely used in emergency medicine,
psychiatry, and general medicine departments. it is mostly used for acute confusional state, psychotic
disorders, agitation, delirium, and aggressive behaviour. overdose of haloperidol can cause sudden deaths.
cardiopulmonary arrest related to use of haloperidol had been reported in literature as case reports but are
very few. no such cases have been reported in india till now. we report a case of cardiac arrest due to the
use of haloperidol.
Answer: [cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia]

Context: neonatal nonoliguric hyperkalemia (nohk) is a metabolic abnormality that occurs in extremely
premature neonates at approximately 24 h after birth and is mainly due to the immature functioning of
the sodium (na+)/potassium (k+) pump. magnesium sulfate is frequently used in obstetrical practice to
prevent preterm labor and to treat preeclampsia; this medication can also cause hypermagnesemia and
hyperkalemia by a mechanism that is different from that of nohk. herein, we report the first case of very
early-onset neonatal hyperkalemia induced by maternal hypermagnesemia. a neonate born at 32 weeks
of gestation developed hyperkalemia (k+ 6.4 mmol/l) 2 h after birth. the neonate’s blood potassium
concentration reached 7.0 mmol/l 4 h after birth, despite good urine output. the neonate and his mother
had severe hypermagnesemia caused by intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate given for tocolysis due
to pre-term labor. the early-onset hyperkalemia may have been caused by the accumulation of potassium
ions transported through the placenta, the shift of potassium ions from the intracellular to the extracellular
space in the infant due to the malfunctioning of the na+/k+ pump and the inhibition of renal distal tube
potassium ion secretion, there is a possibility that these mechanisms were induced by maternal and fetal
hypermagnesemia after maternal magnesium sulfate administration. because neonatal hyperkalemia
poses a significant risk for the development of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, this case highlights
the necessity of maternal blood magnesium monitoring during magnesium sulfate administration and
neonatal blood potassium monitoring when there is severe maternal hypermagnesemia at delivery.
Answer: [exposure during pregnancy, hypermagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypotonia, product use in unapproved indication]

Context: doxycycline and minocycline are tetracyclines with the potential to cause hepatoxicity. although
autoimmune-like hepatitis from minocycline is well-described, doxycycline-induced autoimmune
hepatitis (diah) has only been described once. we report a rare case of diah with elevated liver enzymes
over 5 times the normal upper limit, elevated immunoglobulin g, and high titers of antismooth muscle
antibody and antinuclear antibody. by stopping doxycycline, our patient’s liver enzymes normalized
and immunoglobulin g and autoantibody titers rapidly downtrended. as long-term doxycycline therapy
becomes more prevalent to treat acne vulgaris and other skin conditions, diah may become more prevalent
and recognized.
Answer: [autoimmune hepatitis]


Context: oral mucositis, the most common adverse effect of radiotherapy (rt) and/or chemotherapy is
observed in almost 97% of patients with head and neck cancer. although several agents like corticosteroids,
lidocaine and vitamins are available for its prevention or management, results are often disappointing.
here we report on the effects of a topically applied, highly purified natural deoxyribonucleic acid from
sturgeon gonads on three cases of moderate to severe oral mucositis in patients with head and neck
cancer. three patients who had undergone rt and/or chemotherapy received an oral spray containing
sodium salt-based natural deoxyribonucleic acid (pdrn) for grade 3 oral mucositis. treatment continued
for one month after the end of rt. no patient reported any allergic reactions. rt and chemotherapy were
not interrupted and opioid therapy was not given to any patient. pain was relieved about 2-3 days after
starting treatment and oral mucositis was reduced to g2 within one week. outcomes in all 3 cases showed
topical use of the sodium salt-based pdrn derived from sturgeon gonads was acceptable and safe when
used topically for therapeutic and regenerative purposes.present results are encouraging and suggest a
more in-depth study is warranted on its use in a larger patient cohort with rt-induced oral mucositis.
Answer: [candida infection, dehydration, pain, stomatitis, weight decreased]

Context: background piperacillin/tazobactam is a commonly used antibiotic for the empirical treatment of
severe diabetic foot infections. one of the most feared complications of this drug is the development
of pancytopenia. the aim of this study was to determine whether the use of piperacillin/tazobactam
caused any hematological changes in patients admitted with severe diabetes-related foot infections from a
specialist multidisciplinary foot clinic. specifically, looking at whether it caused anemia, leukopenia,
neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. methods a 1-year retrospective analysis of patients admitted to
a tertiary care center for treatment of diabetes-related foot infection using piperacillin/tazobactam.
hematological indices, urea and electrolytes, and c-reactive protein (crp) were recorded pretreatment,
during treatment, and posttreatment. hba1c, vitamin b12, folate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free
thyroxin were also analyzed to exclude any potential confounders as a cause of pancytopenia. results
a total of 154 patients were admitted between 1 january 2016 and 31 december 2016 who received
piperacillin/tazobactam for severe diabetes-related foot infection. on admission, white cell count and crp
were raised and fell significantly within the first 48 h. other hematological factors did not change. five
patients developed a mild pancytopenia, of which three were unexplained. conclusions in this relatively
small cohort, pancytopenia did not occur. as such, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared to have a low risk of
adverse hematological outcomes and remains the treatment of choice for severe diabetes-related foot
infections.
Answer: [haemoglobin decreased, pancytopenia]"""
